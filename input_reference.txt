#inputs for ARIANNA simulation, do not change order unless you change ReadInput()
10000000 #NNU, setting to 1 for unique neutrino
42      #seed Seed for Rand3
15.0    #EXPONENT, !should be exclusive with SPECTRUM
1000   	#ATGap, distance between stations in meters
0     	#ST_TYPE, !restrict to 0 for now!
4 #N_Ant_perST, not to be confused with ST_TYPE above
2 #N_Ant_Trigger, this is the minimum number of AT to trigger
30    	#Z for ST_TYPE=2
575.0   #ICETHICK, thickness of ice including firn, 575m at Moore's Bay
1    	#FIRN, KD: ensure DEPTH_DEPENDENT is off if FIRN is 0
1.30    #NFIRN 1.30
60   	#FIRNDEPTH in meters
36 #NROWS 12 initially, set to 3 for HEXAGONAL
36 #NCOLS 12 initially, set to 5 for HEXAGONAL
0     	#SCATTER 
1     	#SCATTER_WIDTH,how many times wider after scattering
0     	#SPECTRUM, use spectrum, ! was 1 initially!
0     	#DIPOLE,  add a dipole to the station, useful for st_type=0 and 2
0     	#CONST_ATTENLENGTH, use constant attenuation length if ==1
500   	#ATTEN_UP, this is the conjuction of the plot attenlength_up and attlength_down when setting REFLECT_RATE=0.5(3dB)
250   	#ATTEN_DOWN, this is the average attenlength_down before Minna Bluff measurement(not used anymore except for CONST_ATTENLENGTH)
4 #NSIGMA, threshold of trigger
1.    	#ATTEN_FACTOR, change of the attenuation length 
0.9    #REFLECT_RATE,power reflection rate at the ice bottom
0     	#GZK, 1 means using GZK flux, 0 means E-2 flux
0     	#FANFLUX, use fenfang's flux which only covers from 10^17 eV to 10^20 eV
1   	#WIDESPECTRUM, use 10^16 eV to 10^21.5 eV as the energy spectrum, otherwise use 17-20
1       #SHADOWING
1       #DEPTH_DEPENDENT_N;0 means uniform firn, 1 means n_firn is a function of depth
0 #HEXAGONAL
1       #SIGNAL_FLUCT 1=add noise fluctuation to signal or 0=do not
4.0     #GAINV  gain dependency
1       #TAUREGENERATION if 1=tau regeneration effect, if 0=original
3.5     #ST4_R radius in meters between center of station and antenna
350     #TNOISE noise temperature in Kelvin
